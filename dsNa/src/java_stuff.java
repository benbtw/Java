        In an interface, all methods must be public. If we want to add new methods in the future,
        then an abstract class is a better choice. Because if we add new methods to an interface,
        then all of the classes that already implemented that interface will have to be changed to implement the new methods.

        Here are some examples of using serialization:
        - Storing data in an object-oriented way to files on disk, e.g. storing a list of Student objects.
        - Saving program's states on disk, e.g. saving state of a game.
        - Sending data over the network in form objects, e.g. sending messages as objects in chat application.
